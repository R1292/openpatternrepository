openpatternrepository
=====================

The goal of the Open Pattern Repository (OPR) Project is to create a publicly available and freely usable online repository for patterns with a focus on architectural- and design software patterns. Additional to patterns the repository can be used to capture information about software technologies like frameworks, middlewares and APIs. In the context of the OPR, those technologies are also seen as patterns with a problem description, a solution and a context in which they can be used. That way technologies can be related with patterns and with each other.

A strong emphasis is put on capturing architectural- and design patterns, their known variants, their consequences and especially their various interrelationships. The pattern repository is a web application providing functionality to add, change and remove patterns, to browse patterns according to categories, to find patterns that match certain criteria and finally to create a documentation of a set of chosen patterns. Additionally a part of the specified functionality will be provided as REST-webservices.
